        <h2>Q1: What is the difference between local storage and session storage?</h2>
        <p>Session Storage objects can be accessed using the sessionStorage read-only property. And also Local Storage
          objects can be accessed using the localStorage read-only property. The difference between sessionStorage and
          localStorage is that localStorage data does not expire, whereas sessionStorage data is cleared when the page
          session ends. <br><br>

          localStorage and sessionStorage are perfect for persisting non-sensitive data needed within client scripts
          between pages (for example: preferences, scores in games). The data stored in localStorage and sessionStorage
          can easily be read or changed from within the client/browser so should not be relied upon for storage of
          sensitive or security-related data within applications.</p>

        <h2>Q2: What is the difference between Global scope and block scope?</h2>
        <p><b>Global scope:</b> The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are known as global
          variables and have global scope. Global scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of that
          program, any function or conditional state can access that variable.<br><br>

          <b>Block scope:</b> Block scope is also a sub-type of local scope. The block scope can be defined as the scope
          of the variables inside the curly brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or conditional
          statements, or something else. You are only allowed to refer to these variables from within the curly brackets
          {}.

        <h2>Q3: How does work JavaScript event loop?</h2>
        <p>The event loop is a process that waits for the Call Stack to be clear before pushing callbacks from the Task
          Queue to the Call Stack. Once the Stack is clear, the event loop triggers and checks the Task Queue for
          available callbacks. If there are any, it pushes it to the Call Stack, waits for the Call Stack to be clear
          again, and repeats the same process.</p>

        <h2>Q4: How many ways can we get undefined?</h2>
        <p>8 Ways we get undefined in JavaScript. <br>
          1. variables that not initialized will give undefined. <br>
          2. function with no return. <br>
          3. parameter that is not passed will be undefined. <br>
          4. if return has nothing on the right side will return undefined. <br>
          5. property doesn't exist on an object will give undefined. <br>
          6. accessing array elements outside of index range. <br>
          7. deleting an array element inside an array. <br>
          8. set a value directly to undefined. <br>
